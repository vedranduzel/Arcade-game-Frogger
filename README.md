## Instructions

Evil girl captured a boy and you need to save him.
Reach the top and advance one level every time. You have three lives (hearts at the bottom).
If bugs catch you, you will lose a life and return to the starting point. 
Go around the rocks. Collect diamonds to get more points.
At level 9 you can collect the key and bring it to the boy to set him free. If you die, you have to collect the key again.
Depending did you free the boy or die, mudul (pop up) at the end will change.
You can try to reach more levels (I dare you to reach lvl 20).

## Instalation

You don't need to install the game. Just unpack a file in an empty folder and double click index.html file.
It's important not to change the order of files.

## About

I was provided with a starting code that included images, image loading functions and some canvas functions.
I had to implement functionality using objects and constructor functions.
